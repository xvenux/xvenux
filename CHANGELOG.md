## [Build 73](https://github.com/xvenux?tab=repositories)
**July 15, 2022** - Alpha version

- [`!`] The `Venux` project has moved to a new location. The reason for this is quite dumb but it happened. Around January 2019 I lost an access to my primary email (for whatever reason), miraculously, GitHub decided to validate my account short after (for whatever reason) which I could not do due to not having an access to my email. Being stuck in this situation, I just kept going with development and with perspective to restore everything `in the near future`... So, the work had continued on a daily basis all this time and now I'm going to continue publish changes in this name-space. Anyway, there is simply to much of changes to list here since the last update therefore I'll just upload everything step by step and sync up with further development as time goes on.
